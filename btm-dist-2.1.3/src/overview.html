    The Bitronix Transaction Manager (BTM) is a simple but complete implementation of the JTA API. The goal is to
    provide a fully working XA transaction manager that provides all services required by the JTA API while trying to
    keep the code as simple as possible for easier understanding of the XA semantics.
