        XADataSource emulator using Last Resource Commit on an underlying non-XA DataSource.
        Note that if you use the classes of this package you have accepted the heuristic hazard. A crash 
        during commit of a connection returned by this datasource could lead to an inconsistent global state.
        This is a limitation of the Last Resource Commit technique, not of BTM.
