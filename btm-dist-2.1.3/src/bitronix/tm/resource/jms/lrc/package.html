        XAConnectionFactory emulator using Last Resource Commit on an underlying non-XA ConnectionFactory.
        Note that if you use the classes of this package you have accepted the heuristic hazard. A crash
        during commit of a connection returned by this connection factory could lead to an inconsistent global state.
        This is a limitation of the Last Resource Commit technique, not of BTM.
